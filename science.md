My scientific interest developed during my final internship preparing me for my upcoming diploma thesis. This internship was at the chair of Prof. Dr. Dieter Neher under the supervision of aspiring PhD candidat Patrick Pingel, who is now an established researcher at Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research (IAP) in Potsdam. During my time at the soft matter chair of Prof. Neher, I learned to assemble electrical devices based on polymeric semiconducting layers and measured their charge transport properties by the means of impedance spectroscopy. The fascinating mechanism of transport of charges in organic semiconductors, which is ultimatly restricted by the spatial and energetic disorder of the ensemble of polymers, lead me wanting to understand it better. I got that oppptunity a little bit later at the - at that time - fairly new chair of Prof. Ralf Metzler at Potsdam University, who is an expert in anomalous diffusion. An important reason to why anomalous diffusion can be used to describe the charge transport in organic semiconductors, is that the crossover of the current for short and long time scales can be explained [@PhysRevB.12.2455].
